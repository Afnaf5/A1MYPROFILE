    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
    <h3>Myers Briggs Test</h3>
    <h4>Personality type: Logician (INTP-T)</h4>

    <p>Traits: Introverted – 61%, Intuitive – 66%, Thinking – 80%,
    Prospecting – 79%, Turbulent – 56%
    Role: Analyst
    Strategy: Constant Improvement <br>
    <br>
    INTPs are said to be quiet, reserved and thoughtful. As an INTP, I think
    of myself as an abstract thinker, logical and quite loyal. With that being
    said, I believe these characteristics would be a great addition to any team
    due to myself constantly questioning what could go wrong, and how I can fix
    current and upcoming issues.

    <h3>Online Learning Test</h3>
    <p>Tactile/Kinaesthetic: A kinaesthetic-tactile learning style requires that
    you manipulate or touch material to learn. Kinaesthetic-tactile techniques
    are used in combination with visual and/or auditory study techniques,
    producing multi-sensory learning.
    <br>
    <br>

    As stated in this online learnig test, I thrive with this type of learning
    style. Game developing requires a lot of hands on work paired with visual
    material for myself to manipulate, hence why I believe I would excel within
    the game development industry.
