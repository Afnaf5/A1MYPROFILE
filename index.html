      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Afnaf Hussain. I was born in Bangladesh but moved to
        New Zealand and finally, to Australia, where I completed
        my VCE back in 2014. My hobbies include reading and watching fantasy,
        gaming, lifting weights, skateboarding and eating various types of
        foods. </p>

   <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
   <p>I've been an avid video gamer for years, Assassin's Creed 2, Runescape and
     Pokemon being my favourites. Through my immersion within these worlds, I have come to
     question how it is possible to create such vast and interactable worlds
     that is full of life whilst sitting behind a computer. Hence, my interest
     in information technology. As I progress further into my studies, I expect
     to learn different coding languages (Python, C++, etc). With these acquired
      skills, I will implement them into my future projects.  </p>
